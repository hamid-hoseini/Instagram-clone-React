# Instagram clone with REACT
  A copy of the Instagram app to learn and improve coding skills with the React platform.
  (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase v9, NextAuth, Recoil)
  
  Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Next.js v10+ project:

  ```bash
  yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
  
  # Run the application:
  npm run dev
  ```

## What I have learned in this project are:

  1. Define `images.domains` config in `next.config.js` if any pages that leverages the next/image component and we passed a src value that uses a hostname in the URL. [Read more...](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/next-image-unconfigured-host)
  2. Adding custom styles to Tailwind and using CSS and `@layer` [Read more...](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-css-and-layer)
  3. Using **Faker-js** to generate massive amounts of fake (but realistic) data for testing and development. [Read more...](https://github.com/faker-js/faker)
